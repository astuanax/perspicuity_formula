# Perspicuity Formula

The Perspicuity Formula library provides a tool to calculate the readability score for Spanish texts based on the F칩rmula de Perspicuidad. This formula helps determine the ease of understanding a given text, making it useful for writers, educators, and content creators who want to ensure their material is accessible to their intended audience.

```
use perspicuity_formula::PerspicuityFormula;

fn main() {
    let text = "Este es un texto de prueba. Est치 dise침ado para verificar la f칩rmula de perspicuidad.";
    let pf = PerspicuityFormula::new();
    let score = pf.calculate(text);
    println!("Perspicuity Score: {}", score);
}
```

## Features

- Calculate the Perspicuity Score for Spanish texts.
- Automatically count sentences, words, and syllables in the text.
- Provides a score clamped between 0 and 100 for easy interpretation.
